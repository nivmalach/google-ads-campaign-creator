# Developer Token Status Check

The error "The developer token is not valid" typically means one of these issues:

## 1. **Basic Access Limitations**

"Basic Access" has daily quota limits but should work. However, it might take time to activate after approval.

## 2. **Token Not Fully Approved Yet**

Even after receiving "Basic Access", the token might need 24-48 hours to propagate through Google's systems.

## 3. **OAuth Project Mismatch**

The OAuth Client ID/Secret must be from the **same Google Cloud Project** that's linked to your Google Ads Manager Account.

## How to Verify

### Step 1: Check Developer Token Status
1. Go to: https://ads.google.com/aw/apicenter
2. Log in to your Google Ads **Manager Account** (not individual account)
3. Check the status shows "**Basic access**" or "**Standard access**"
4. If it shows "Applied for basic access" - it's still pending

### Step 2: Verify OAuth Credentials Project
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Check which project your OAuth credentials (`GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID`) are from
3. This project must be the **same one** linked to your Google Ads account

### Step 3: Check Manager Account
The developer token must come from a **Manager Account** (not a regular Google Ads account).

- Manager Account IDs are typically 10 digits and show "Manager" in the interface
- Regular accounts won't work for API access

## Quick Test

**Can you please check:**

1. Is your developer token from a **Manager Account**?
2. What's the exact status shown in the API Center? ("Basic access" vs "Applied for basic access")
3. How long ago was it approved?
4. Are your OAuth credentials from the same Google Cloud Project linked to this Manager Account?

## Possible Solution: Test Account

If your token is new, try using a **Test Manager Account** first:

1. In API Center, you can create a "Test" manager account
2. This works immediately without approval
3. You can verify the integration works before production use
